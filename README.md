# Moody


This app allows a person to create a "New Mood" which entails selecting an image of your current mood as well as filling in what is happening at the moment. Once you have done this it will take you to a "For your mood" page whichh displays your mood, what you entered as well as a quote for that specific mood, as well as 3 song suggestions.

The process I took of making the app:
#1 Creating a basic empty Xamarin.Forms project in Visual Studio
#2 Creating all the necessary files that I would need
#3 Create the "Home" pages' button to navigate to "New Mood" page
#4 Create the "New Mood" page with all the necessary mood buttons and form entry
#5 Create the "For your mood" page
#6 Save data chosen and entered on "New Mood" page to local storage
#7 Load the data stored in local storage for the "For yor mood" page

I think this app is successful because it achieves the task that it was created to do.

Improvements to be made:
#1 Save the moods to a list to display the history according to date
